<p><strong>Summary: </strong> Experimental ticket system for an IT-department. The project uses modern React and the main purpose of this project was to learn more about Context API and Redux. This SPA is only a small frontend application so no backend was made for it. Instead, I used a fake REST API package called JSON Server.
